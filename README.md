## Haarcascades



### The problem

I realized one of the major problems in the online era was faced by the teachers. Online classes are just the tip of the iceberg. As I would personally supply teachers with the screenshots as attendance, I realized the effort the teacher needed to give into maintaining a proper register for the same on a daily basis.


### The solution


Hence as I was learning opencv and the haarcascade library, I really wanted to do something for my teachers. The following code enables one to get the number of attendees in a big meeting for example. This will be particularly useful while compiling the attendance for an entire semester.
